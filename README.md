# Lyricfy
Chrome extension that automatically pulls lyrics in Spotify web player.

# Caveat
This extention grabs the lyrics through web scraping, which is against most websites' TOS. Thus, it should not be used in production, which is why it is not uploaded on the Chrome Store.

# How to install

1. Download 'Lyricfy' folder
2. Go to Chrome menu -> Extensions -> Load Unpacked
3. Select the downloaded folder and you are done!

# How to use
Everytime you listen to music through https://www.open.spotify.com, the extention automacally pulls the lyrics of the current song and displays it on a sidebar on the right. To toggle between showing/hiding the lyrics, press the green `Lyrics` button next to Spotify's volume bar.
